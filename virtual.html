        During the covid-19 pandemic school changed to virtual learning because it was safe. In the article(“Online learning vs. in-person classes- what better..’’ “In-person vs online learning-can they compare?”), the difference between virtual learning and in-person and whether to help the student or not . Many students thought it was difficult because they could not get help from the teacher and it was more self-directed. In-person learning allows students to have social interaction but a lot of people have social anxiety may it be difficult for them. The virtual learning has flexible time allowing students to work on their only time and able to use many apps. For example, zoom and google classroom. In-person learning allows students to have teacher support. When changed to virtual learning the covid-19 cases went down and became more safe but, the students are not getting the education they need.

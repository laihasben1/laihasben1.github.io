          >Summary </h2>
      <p> One of the biggest problems with America’s education system is the inequality between schools in high income areas and schools with low income areas. Schools in higher income areas have easier access to technology, textbooks, guidance counselors, and other resources. These schools also tend to have more enriching electives and clubs and the standards for education and involvement tend to be higher. The food is usually healthier and more of a variety than in low income schools. The appearance of the schools are cleaner and richer looking, which affects the way students work. Schools with lower income have a harder time achieving these things because of the lack of money. Since these schools are not receiving the same treatment as higher paying areas, the students struggle to succeed in high school.

          >Amount of Resources </h2>
        <p> 
      <h4 style="color:#fd6c9e;"
          >Technology </h4>
        </h4>
        <p> 
          The lack of technology in low income areas affects the high schoolers in a negative way and sets them behind highschoolers in high income areas. In higher income areas, high schoolers are given laptops or ipads, or they are able to afford to buy their own. These tools allow the students and the teachers to work and learn more efficiently. The students can type their notes, use online resources, and communicate with peers easily. However, students from low income schools often struggle with getting their hands on a working computer, thus preventing them from using the technology in a beneficial way. Even if the school is able to give the students an ipad or laptop, the school often does not have the money to fix these electronics if they get a virus or are broken. These students then have to suffer because of this lack of resources for them. They aren’t receiving the same opportunities as the students that come from a richer area. Especially in a changing world where technology has such a huge impact on our lives and on the job industry, knowing how to work technology is extremely important and useful. Children who may not even have access to technology, let alone learn it, are already behind in life.

      >Textbooks </h4>
        <p> Textbooks can be crucial to a student’s education. The textbooks help students learn the material and follow along with the curriculum. Often, teachers will teach right from the textbook and give their tests based on that information. In lower income schools, however, many students are not able to receive textbooks or if they do, the textbooks are ruined and falling apart or there isn’t enough. This impacts the students in a negative way. The textbook is an excellent resource for taking notes before or after class. Without the textbooks, the students would have to just take notes from in class instead of participating in engaged learning. Students from higher income areas are able to use textbooks to catch up on work, get ahead, or reinforce what they had learned in class. Again, a lack of resources is causing the students to fall behind because of something that is out of their control.

      >Counseling </h4>
        <p> A majority of teenagers struggle with mental health and also with the whole college process. In almost all high income areas, the schools are equipped with multiple counselors, such as a college counselor and a psychological counselor. The college counselors guide the students through the process of choosing colleges, applying, writing the essays, and dealing with the stress of it. These counselors set up the students for success. The psychological counselors are there to help the students who are struggling with school or family issues. This is extremely important because more and more students are becoming severely depressed or anxious every day. The suicide rates have also increased. In low income areas, there tends to be a lack of counseling. The reason for this is when there is a budget cut or a financial shortfall, the counselors are the first people to be let go. An important thing to note is that counseling is a need and not a luxury. Your mental being is just as important as your education. According to Education Week, only 1 in 5 students who show symptoms of mental health issues receive help at school. This is not acceptable and the students need more support from the school and district area.

          >Electives & Clubs </h2>
        <p> Various electives/clubs are not only important for colleges but also for the overall wellbeing. Over 95% of Americans think electives are essential and beneficial for a child’s development. They also create new opportunities for students to figure out what their passions are. In higher income schools, there are way more elective and club options and more resources for each club/elective. For example, robotics is an excellent club/elective that impresses colleges and lets students with creative minds explore. However, robotics can be pricey when it comes to all the material needed and entering competitions. Higher income schools meet the requirements, but many lower income schools do not. Thus, putting these students behind, yet again. In lower income schools, the demands are more shifted towards the core classes. The creative classes like art and music are dwindling. According to the National Education Association, in New York City alone, over 233 elective teachers of athletics, music, and the arts were laid off because of funding issues and respect for the arts. This is not fair to the students of lower income schools who don’t get the same opportunities as the richer kids.

          >Teachers </h2>
        <p> Teachers are essential for a good education. If the teacher is good, it is more likely the student will succeed. In higher income schools, the standards for teachers are higher. The school has the flexibility to hire and fire teachers whenever they seem fit. In lower income schools, the school tends to have a harder time finding a qualified teacher who is willing to get paid little. Low income schools tend to end up with the worst teachers. These teachers have proven to have produced the smallest test score gains and had the fewest years of experience and lowest licensure exam scores.

          >Environment </h2>
        <p> The school’s environment is also important for the students mentally and physically. An example of how the environment of a school negatively impacted the students is the Paterson public school. The school got so bad that it had to be closed down. The AC didn’t work, there were mice running around, and the ventilation system and heating were unsafe. In Dillion school district four, they masked water damage by gluing plywood to classroom walls. In a lot of the low income schools, the punishment is to clean the school. Comparing this to the environment of higher income schools, it’s ridiculous. Higher income schools look nicer and all the functions are properly running. There’s also enough money for extra rooms like a gym, pool, track room, sound booths, etc.

          >Food </h2>
        <p> Healthy food is a necessity for teens. Fortunately, recently, a program called the National School Lunch Program has enabled public schools to offer their students free healthy food. But for other lower income schools that don’t have this, the food is not that great. Often the food is processed which increases obesity and health issues. Healthy food helps with concentration and performance in class, which is why every school should be serving healthy nutritious food. In high income areas, the food is NOT free but it is healthy and often there are high quality personal chefs that cook the food. There is also more of a variety of food.

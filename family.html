        Summary
      </h2>
      <p>
        Education is something that's very important and it could determine how good someone's future could be. However, not everyone has the same quantity and quality of education. There is a big difference in how much education a person can get on certain circumstances
        This makes it unfair for people who has lower education and cause people with good education to have a better head start for a better future. A huge factor of this would be your family.

        Family Background
      </h3>
      <p1>
        Family background affects ones education greatly because poor households have less access to learning materials and experiences, including books, computers, stimulating toys, skill-building lessons, or tutors to create a positive literacy environment.
        They are also less likely to have experiences that encourage the development of fundamental skills of reading acquisition, such as phonological awareness, vocabulary, and oral language.
        Prospective college students from low-SES backgrounds are less likely to have access to informational resources about college 
        Additionally, compared to high-SES counterparts, young adults from low-SES backgrounds are at a higher risk of accruing student loan debt burdens that exceed the national average. 
        Therefore, family background is a very important factor of having a good education and plays a big part in having good quality education.

        Family Income and Education Level
      </h4>
      <p2>
       The family income and education level also affects the children getting a good education. Studies show that of students who in enroll in public four year universities 
        45% had parents with college degree and 26% who did not. Its also to be said that 86% of children with parents who had less than a high school degree is considered to have low income
        compared to 67% of children's parent who had a high school degree and 31% with at least one parent with collge degree. At the same time parents who struggle financially tend to grapple with depression, low-self esteem, and etc. which could pass on to their children.

        Family Environment
      </h5>
      <p3>
      The environment of how the child lives under from young age will greatly affect what and how they will behave in the future. if the child is living under a negative family environment will result in anxiety, depression, and stress. It will also lead them to be disencouraged and abusive family environment will cause the child to be abusive and take out that stress by bullying other people.
      The family environment is also linked to family income because low income parents would be stress and interact less with their child while better income parents engage with their child more; better educated parents also tend to provide a more positive household.

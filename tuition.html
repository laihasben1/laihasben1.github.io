         - In the education system tuition is the biggest problem in colleges in the U.S. Most colleges the first place they choose for the money to go towards isn’t the classroom. Colleges are also raising the tuition, this makes students take out more loans which is more debt to pay off after they graduate. There is about $1.5 trillion dollars just in the U.S. for student debt. On average it takes about 19 years for a U.S. student to pay off their student loans.

        - Tuition in schools (highschool,college,pre-k, all types of schools) over the past two decades has risen more than health care, child care, and medical services. Even when students are applying to colleges it’s fees. For example at Harvard $100 is for the application fee times that by the 57,000 applications they received for class of 2025 it adds up. They only accepted 1,223 of the applications so most students paid $100 just to get a “sorry you weren’t accepted” letter.
